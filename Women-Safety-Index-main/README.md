# LLM BasedWomen Safety Prediction App 🛡️

**Women Safety App** is a real-time safety intelligence platform designed to empower women with data-driven environmental awareness. It combines historical safety aggregates with live environmental data (like ambient light levels) and a cutting-edge **Hybrid AI Assistant** to provide actionable safety advice.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Hybrid AI Intelligence
The app features a sophisticated **Safety Assistant** with an automatic failover system:
- **Cloud (Groq)**: Uses Llama 3.1 via Groq for near-instant, high-intelligence safety summaries.
- **Local (Ollama)**: Automatically falls back to a local Gemma 3 (1B) model if the cloud is unavailable, ensuring the app works even in "offline" or high-privacy modes.

### 💡 Live Environmental Sensing (Lux)
The first safety app to implement **Dynamic Safety Indexing**:
- Integrates with the phone's **Ambient Light Sensor**.
- Automatically applies safety penalties to areas at night if they are poorly lit.
- **Sensor Smoothing**: Uses a moving average algorithm to prevent safety score flickering.

### 🍱 Bento Grid Area Intelligence
Get a professional, at-a-glance safety report using our custom Bento UI:
- **Vibe Check**: High-level feeling of the location.
- **Crowd Density**: Real-time/historical occupancy data.
- **Recent Incidents**: Direct insights from the crime dataset.

### 🗺️ Interactive Safety Map
- Visualizes safety scores across the city using custom map tiles.
- High-confidence safety clusters mapped via historical data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the entire platform up and running, follow these steps in order:

### 1. Environment Setup (One-Time)
We have merged all Backend and Machine Learning requirements into a single, unified `requirements.txt` file at the root.

```bash

# Install all Backend & ML dependencies in one go
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Data Generation & Model Training (ML)
Since we do not commit massive datasets to GitHub, you must generate the synthetic data and model files first:

1. Open the `ml/` directory on your machine.
2. Since you already installed the dependencies in Step 1, you can directly run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:
   - **`Data_Creation.ipynb`**: Generates the raw `synthetic_wsi_delhi_localities.csv` (1,000,000 rows) and pre-computes the initial `locality_aggregates.json`.
   - **`Feature_Engineering.ipynb`**: Transforms variables and encodes cyclic times to output `synthetic_wsi_delhi_engineered.csv`.
   - **`ML.ipynb`**: Trains the XGBoost regression model, producing `xgboost_wsi_model.json`.
3. If you want to update the backend's active lookup table with your freshly trained data, make sure the generated `locality_aggregates.json` is present in the root directory.

---

### 3. Backend Setup & Run
The backend files live directly in the root of the repository.

**Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Start Backend Server:**
Ensure your virtual environment is still active, then run:
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

### 4. Frontend Setup (Mobile App)
Now launch the interactive React Native mobile application:

```bash
cd wsi-app
npm install
npx expo start -c
```

### 3. AI Setup (Optional)
To use the local fallback, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and run:
```bash
ollama run gemma3:1b
```

## 📈 The Safety Logic
The **Safety Index** (0-100) is calculated as:
`Base Score (Dataset) × Lux Penalty (Live Sensor) = Final Safety Score`

- **Daytime**: The sensor is ignored (assumed to be in a pocket/bag).
- **Nighttime**: If Lux < 10, a **30% penalty** is applied.
- **Shadow Detection**: In commercial/campus zones, extremely low light triggers a **Shadow Penalty**.
